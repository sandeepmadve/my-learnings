- Passion is not something you find. It’s something you grow.
- Don’t think everyone wants to lead. 99% of people want to be led. They want to be told what to do. Led them.
- Be curious. It’s what creates opportunities more than hard work ever will.
- We procrastinate not because of laziness but because of fear.
- Be busy in finding yourself instead of being busy in the rate race and never knowing yourself.
